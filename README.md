## Entry and Exit Criteria Document
## Only portrait mode is in the scope for this project

### Entry Criteria:

- **Feature Completion:** Ensure all features (basic calculations, decimals, negative/positive signs, memory functions,
  percentage conversion, copy function) are fully implemented.
- **Unit Testing**: Verify that developers have conducted unit testing for individual components.
- **Development Integration:** Confirm the integration of new features with existing functionalities.
- **Initial Developer Testing:** Ensure that a round of testing has been performed by the development team.
- **Documentation Review:** Review requirement specifications and design layouts for clarity and completeness.

### Exit Criteria:

- **Completion of All Test Cases:** All planned test cases, including newly added ones, have been executed with a
  specified percentage pass rate.
- **No Critical Bugs Open:** There are no critical defects or bugs unresolved.
- **Regression Testing Completed:** Full regression testing has been conducted to ensure new changes have not adversely
  affected existing functionalities.
- **Performance and Compatibility Testing:** The app has been tested for performance and compatibility on various iOS
  devices running iOS 12 or higher.
- **Incorporation into Automated Regression Suite:** New test cases have been successfully added to the automated
  regression test suite.
- **Documentation of Known Issues:** Any known issues are documented, along with potential workarounds.


## Type of tests to perform:
- Functionality Testing
- Usability Testing: Ensure the app is user-friendly and accessible.
- Compatibility Testing: Test on different iOS devices running iOS 12 or higher.
- Non-functional Testing: Performance testing for rapid calculations.<br>Stress testing for consecutive operations
  without crashes or lags.
- Edge Case Testing: Test with extremely large numbers, test consecutive operations without clearing the memory.
